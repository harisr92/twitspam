friday night movies at the green muse: the jerk. the friday night ritual with @mirven continues.
try to walk away with the good bits while leaving all the celebrity-based authoritative ideas on the cutting room floor :)
no doubt it's shallow. the issue is how to shape our actions and decisions knowing this to cause the least harm.
no. not just me. anyone in your community that is visible. seb for example. this is how social authority and social capital works
the perceived value of the active nodes in your social network gives you as much influence as any code you write
a tremendous amount of choice is made in these communities based on opportunities to get close to celebrities
never let it be said that rationality or merit ever got in the way of a bad decision in the alt/net communities :)
google juice isn't what influences the .net community, and especially not the alt.net community
dogfooding the wrong thing without a vision for the right thing just gets the wrong thing's bugs worked out
it's not the dogfooding that matters, it's the years of experience in critical thinking and diversity applied to the dogfooding.
dogfooding doesn't get us anything either if we just do the dogfooding according to our presumptions (see: Microsoft and TFS)
it's great to have an open mind, but be conscious of the influence you have once something is released to the wild
far too much time was spent in asp mvc design review on listening to people who had never built asp apps who are celebrities
if the .net community at large were able to discern goodness based solely on merit, the asp mvc framework would have been better
in the .net community, people pay attention to technology not because it's good, but because it's mentioned by celebrities
discerning the least desirable path means synthesizing many, many more factors to arrive at a more holistic context
you won't find a hack implementation that is undesirable, but you can inevitably differentiate least desirable.
no doubt they're both flawed. the dialog about the least-flawed is inevitably a dialog about whole and systemic analysis.
ultimately, i'm gonna come gunning for you if this hack-in-the-uri becomes convention in the late-to-the-game .net rest users :)
it's going well. it's not meant to be an overnight change but a long-term campaign of subtle (and not so subtle) influence
in the end, i still hear you saying things that kinda sound like 'because it's easier for me to do it this way'
as an 'advocate of both Test-Driven Development and Domain Driven Design', you're guilty by association :)
the issue here isn't just testing and testability. the issue is finding the right abstraction and applying rules for workarounds.
it was microsoft's naivety toward testing that spurred the greater rift between the 'us' and the 'them'. it's all framework design
once you've got rails running in your shop, there isn't much justification to run it on a slower virtual machine
iron ruby won't make rails adoptable for .net shops. they'll still go asp.net mvc - otherwise they'd be using rails now.
doesn't this all remind you just a little bit with alt.net's arguments with microsoft product teams about testing?
(not 'impact11', but 'impact!!')
test models will have have to be aware that there is more information in the uri than the resource address. that's impact11
honesty, it's not a framework developer's position to dictate the impact of the framework on testing: see microsoft and 'sealed'
yep, and continue to weep to watch the alt.net'ers repeat the mistakes that other cultures made years ago :)
for the tester, it's not a matter that the impact on test models is minimal - the problem is that it's there at all
if the asp.net mvc framework is the obstruction, never a better time to use the public github fork, and change it
i don't readily accept that the uri is the right mechanism for representing low-level protocol mechanics. bury the hack.
'test models' (or 'test abstractions'): applying model-driven (or domain-driven) design to test design
instincts tell me that having to account for the fake verb in test models will show that the verb is in the wrong place
but that envelope issue is your problem as the framework developer :)
you can add the hack to query string params, but that brings me back to the proximity factor
@bellware a query string param is a param for the resource address itself; refining the meaning of the essential purpose address itself
i would always be accounting for it in testing, and inevitably tripping over it. rails used to do it this way too.
you can append to a uri, and that's a mutation. you can add an atomic form var without mutating any others.
to create an anti-corruption, try to do something additive first.
putting the verb in the uri has greater semantic impact. it's not additive, it's destructive (a mutation)
right. my bad, meant the form verb. the verb isn't in the uri.
the form action isn't as close to the resource address itself as it is to the form data and headers (imo)

@GeePawHill Agreed.  Win-lose is theft, not profit, unless both parties accept the transaction and the risk.
When profit is based on win-win, then the more profit you make the more other people win from your efforts.  Honor.
@casademora Money is a symbol of your hard work, effective thought, &amp; courage of action.  Take pride in your's; don't despise others theirs.
@thomasjeffrey Cool!  Sorry about the RSI.  Glad you are self-reliant.
@louis_salin I will not be responsible for your happiness.  I don't expect you to be responsible for mine.
@tobytripp We trust the profit motive.  We buy health care from companies who provide best services for least money.
@keithb_b I think you'll find quite a few &quot;burned&quot; capitalists if you look.  Few escaped unless they were shielded by govt.
@jtimberman I disagree.  Corruption is present in all human activities.  Banks and Ins co's are not special.
@southda No.  Profit as the primary focus is honorable, because it is based upon win-win, not win-lose.
@eghm anything can be perverted, but the concept of profit is honorable.
@tobytripp I want my health providers motivated to care for me.
@tomasekeli any disregard of ethics is evil. Profit has nothing to do with it.
@cerebrum666 who decides how much is too much?
For some strange reason people think that &quot;profit&quot; is &quot;evil&quot;.  On the contrary, profit is honorable.  Without it, we'd still be in caves.
@casademora What do you mean by &quot;non-profit&quot;?  Who, in the provider chain, should not be making money?  Doctors?  Nurses?  Hospitals?

@therealhoff that's simple: things in austin are always a struggle. it's a crucible.
@therealhoff courage and energy are easy to come by when empathy and responsibility are already in play
@therealhoff knowing the difference is irrelevant unless it's coupled with knowing how to make a difference
@therealhoff corporate behavior is changing all the time. the issue is knowing which changes are better, and to work toward them
@hotgazpacho since there isn't a lot written about it, the absolute best thing to do is to not presume what context specification is
@therealhoff the only culture that isn't amenable to change is one that is populated by dead people
@therealhoff there are some of us who, when we work in corporate IT, change corporate IT
@Jason_Diamond yes, i meant tool. context specification is much more than a tool. it's a holistic communication, analysis. design method
@therealhoff the only thing more mind boggling is corporate IT people who know better but who do nothing to improve the situation
@Jason_Diamond when you say 'C/S', do you mean 'framework' or 'methodology'?
@Jason_Diamond but context specification isn't a syntax, it's a methodology that has a grammar of the same name
@Jason_Diamond simple: gwt is an awkward, unnatural grammar that is too prose-ish to represent atomic facts
longing for a time when more people understand how to use context specification to replace long form requirements (including stories)
@keithb_b i was just thinking the same thing. this keeps happening again and again. i personally feel the same about fit and cucumber.
the document i hold in my hand is what happens when business people think that writing uses cases is a fulltime job for a month. primitive.
whoever told business people that writing the most and the most detailed use cases helps software development should be out of the gene pool
oh boy. use cases. nothing more enjoyable than a day reading use cases.

@gshutler try to walk away with the good bits while leaving all the celebrity-based authoritative ideas on the cutting room floor :)
@gshutler no doubt it's shallow. the issue is how to shape our actions and decisions knowing this to cause the least harm.
@gshutler no. not just me. anyone in your community that is visible. seb for example. this is how social authority and social capital works
@gshutler the perceived value of the active nodes in your social network gives you as much influence as any code you write
@gshutler a tremendous amount of choice is made in these communities based on opportunities to get close to celebrities
@gshutler never let it be said that rationality or merit ever got in the way of a bad decision in the alt/net communities :)
@gshutler google juice isn't what influences the .net community, and especially not the alt.net community
@gshutler dogfooding the wrong thing without a vision for the right thing just gets the wrong thing's bugs worked out
@gshutler it's not the dogfooding that matters, it's the years of experience in critical thinking and diversity applied to the dogfooding.
@gshutler dogfooding doesn't get us anything either if we just do the dogfooding according to our presumptions (see: Microsoft and TFS)
@gshutler it's great to have an open mind, but be conscious of the influence you have once something is released to the wild
@gshutler far too much time was spent in asp mvc design review on listening to people who had never built asp apps who are celebrities
@gshutler if the .net community at large were able to discern goodness based solely on merit, the asp mvc framework would have been better
@gshutler in the .net community, people pay attention to technology not because it's good, but because it's mentioned by celebrities
@gshutler discerning the least desirable path means synthesizing many, many more factors to arrive at a more holistic context
@gshutler you won't find a hack implementation that is undesirable, but you can inevitably differentiate least desirable.
@gshutler no doubt they're both flawed. the dialog about the least-flawed is inevitably a dialog about whole and systemic analysis.
@gshutler ultimately, i'm gonna come gunning for you if this hack-in-the-uri becomes convention in the late-to-the-game .net rest users :)
@gshutler it's going well. it's not meant to be an overnight change but a long-term campaign of subtle (and not so subtle) influence
@gshutler in the end, i still hear you saying things that kinda sound like 'because it's easier for me to do it this way'
@gshutler as an 'advocate of both Test-Driven Development and Domain Driven Design', you're guilty by association :)
@gshutler the issue here isn't just testing and testability. the issue is finding the right abstraction and applying rules for workarounds.
@gshutler it was microsoft's naivety toward testing that spurred the greater rift between the 'us' and the 'them'. it's all framework design
@gshutler once you've got rails running in your shop, there isn't much justification to run it on a slower virtual machine
@gshutler iron ruby won't make rails adoptable for .net shops. they'll still go asp.net mvc - otherwise they'd be using rails now.
@gshutler doesn't this all remind you just a little bit with alt.net's arguments with microsoft product teams about testing?
@gshutler (not 'impact11', but 'impact!!')
@gshutler test models will have have to be aware that there is more information in the uri than the resource address. that's impact11
@gshutler honesty, it's not a framework developer's position to dictate the impact of the framework on testing: see microsoft and 'sealed'
@gshutler yep, and continue to weep to watch the alt.net'ers repeat the mistakes that other cultures made years ago :)
@gshutler for the tester, it's not a matter that the impact on test models is minimal - the problem is that it's there at all
@gshutler if the asp.net mvc framework is the obstruction, never a better time to use the public github fork, and change it
@gshutler i don't readily accept that the uri is the right mechanism for representing low-level protocol mechanics. bury the hack.
@gshutler 'test models' (or 'test abstractions'): applying model-driven (or domain-driven) design to test design
@gshutler instincts tell me that having to account for the fake verb in test models will show that the verb is in the wrong place
@gshutler but that envelope issue is your problem as the framework developer :)
@gshutler you can add the hack to query string params, but that brings me back to the proximity factor
@bellware a query string param is a param for the resource address itself; refining the meaning of the essential purpose address itself
@gshutler i would always be accounting for it in testing, and inevitably tripping over it. rails used to do it this way too.
@gshutler you can append to a uri, and that's a mutation. you can add an atomic form var without mutating any others.
@gshutler to create an anti-corruption, try to do something additive first.
@gshutler putting the verb in the uri has greater semantic impact. it's not additive, it's destructive (a mutation)
@gshutler right. my bad, meant the form verb. the verb isn't in the uri.
@gshutler the form action isn't as close to the resource address itself as it is to the form data and headers (imo)
@gshutler it's a matter of where to hang the hack. it needs to corrupt the thing that it is most proximal to. in this case, the form action
@gshutler the resource address is the outermost surface - the essence - of the request; not just because it's exposed through user agent ui
@gshutler if (and only if) the hack can't be completely encapsulated, then (and only then) should it start bubbling toward the surface
@gshutler it's important to never loose track of what is happening here is a hack, and there are some good guidelines for anti-corruption
the big lebowsky has ruined my ability to watch tron. it's just too hard to retrofit @tedneward into the glowing-pants/light-cycle character
@gshutler what do you mean by 'corrupt'?
@gshutler not the visibility, but it's purpose and meaning as a resource address. the visibility comes into play when encapsulating a hack.
@gshutler i didn't come to that conclusion :) regardless of what the uri gets put into, putting stuf into the uri itself is not the same
@gshutler the resource address is the least encapsulated way to do this representation
@gshutler eitherway, it needs to be a workaround, but the workaround should be proximal to its source and more strongly encapsulated
@gshutler yes, and agree with that as well, but then i fall back to the issue of the abstraction and the proximity to the truth
@gshutler in a scenario where restful addressing is in-play, i see the uri as the resource address and only the resource address
@gshutler i think the difference here is how we conceive of a uri. i see the pseudo verb in the uri as a cognitive holdover from webforms.
@gshutler putting the pseudo verb in the form puts it right where the real verbs are. that's closer the the truth that the resource address.
@gshutler i don't want anything coupled to the resources address than the address of the resource. it's just a bad coupling.
@gshutler i can't tell you the specifics right off the bat. i can smell it though. my functional testing spider senses are screaming.
@gshutler you're going to make my life in functional testing a living hell if you put it on the uri
@gshutler and hey! it's the microsoft dev community! you could do it with a browser plugin and call it &quot;IE only' :)
@gshutler it's like one degree of separation from exposing it through the user's interface
@gshutler nonetheless, i'm pretty uncomfortable with using the uri as a compensator for infrastructural stuff
@gshutler those darned user agents continue to fail to recognize ALL the pesky verbs
@gshutler i appreciate the thinking that you're investing in this. asp mvc's sphere of influence demands it. good that you're stepping up.
@marknoble ha! nice catch. embarrassing. thanks!
@bellware i agree with you about that. it's a matter of responsibility. marketers' responsibility is to not occlude the consumer's awareness
@gshutler (i'm not a big fan of verbs being a part of a resources' address, in case you missed it :)
@gshutler and then the more proximal abstraction to from action is form data
@gshutler well, if verbs are represented by headers, then representing them there is more truthful
@gshutler i'd go back to: is a header a more pre-eminent form of representation for content specification?
@gshutler i'm not saying i have the answer here, but i'm always leary of hints of facilitation occluding representation
@gshutler that atomic data makes for an easier programming model in the framework code, but is it the right abstraction

@kylieireland such a decadent life... those wafers are awesome!
@lancewalley I'm assuming he means a guitar
@jcrosby nice
@jmeowmeow I mean they'd provide a veritable buffet for vampires.  Replication would be a problem, as well as when there's no more homeless
@pbiegaj FYI, Mtn Vw had crystal clear blue skies when I got home.  Warm out of the wind &amp; in the sun.  Alas there was a strong, cool breeze
@tirsen it was so worth it though
@tirsen that's my understanding.  I ended up doing an unplanned iMac upgrade/replacement.
@pbiegaj and vampires can be classy... as opposed to zombies.
@pbiegaj thoughts of vampires: just got season 3 of Forever Knight, and Season 1 of True Blood. And planning a vampire deck for magic
@batasrki possible. Unless they could be neutered.

Yup. Perfect solution to the homeless/derilict/bum problem.

@GeePawHill but I'm a language bigot.  If I have to care about what things *are* as opposed to what they *do*, I'm not so interested.
@GeePawHill yup.. 'cept Java (the language) sucks.  I'd rather work in C++ (or moreso ObjC) if I couldn't work in Ruby.  ...

@davengeo I prefer the more honorable definition.
@GeePawHill I find it interesting that you would think any part of my thinking is cynical.  In general I'm a wild optimist.
You cannot make profit unethically.  Money obtained unethically is theft not profit.  Profit is always win-win.
@GeePawHill Points of unanticipated agreement suggest a connection deeper than the argued issues.
@GeePawHill Agreed.  Win-lose is theft, not profit, unless both parties accept the transaction and the risk.
When profit is based on win-win, then the more profit you make the more other people win from your efforts.  Honor.
@casademora Money is a symbol of your hard work, effective thought, &amp; courage of action.  Take pride in your's; don't despise others theirs.
@thomasjeffrey Cool!  Sorry about the RSI.  Glad you are self-reliant.
@louis_salin I will not be responsible for your happiness.  I don't expect you to be responsible for mine.
@tobytripp We trust the profit motive.  We buy health care from companies who provide best services for least money.
@keithb_b I think you'll find quite a few &quot;burned&quot; capitalists if you look.  Few escaped unless they were shielded by govt.
@jtimberman I disagree.  Corruption is present in all human activities.  Banks and Ins co's are not special.
@southda No.  Profit as the primary focus is honorable, because it is based upon win-win, not win-lose.
@eghm anything can be perverted, but the concept of profit is honorable.
@tobytripp I want my health providers motivated to care for me.
@tomasekeli any disregard of ethics is evil. Profit has nothing to do with it.
@cerebrum666 who decides how much is too much?
For some strange reason people think that &quot;profit&quot; is &quot;evil&quot;.  On the contrary, profit is honorable.  Without it, we'd still be in caves.
@casademora What do you mean by &quot;non-profit&quot;?  Who, in the provider chain, should not be making money?  Doctors?  Nurses?  Hospitals?

@roynmoore ps: i'm really not a fan of flagrant misrepresentation as an invitation to dialog. how many people have learned from me?
@roynmoore the method is good. the problem is the venues for teaching it. you want to learn it, i'll come to you. i'm not very expensive.
this is the last use case document i read without an hourly fee attached. this thoughtlessness in software really must come to an end.
took a break from use case reading. the raw rage that builds in me when indulging these wasteful practices make this hard.
@therealhoff that's simple: things in austin are always a struggle. it's a crucible.
@therealhoff courage and energy are easy to come by when empathy and responsibility are already in play
@therealhoff knowing the difference is irrelevant unless it's coupled with knowing how to make a difference
@therealhoff corporate behavior is changing all the time. the issue is knowing which changes are better, and to work toward them
@hotgazpacho since there isn't a lot written about it, the absolute best thing to do is to not presume what context specification is
@therealhoff the only culture that isn't amenable to change is one that is populated by dead people
@therealhoff there are some of us who, when we work in corporate IT, change corporate IT
@Jason_Diamond yes, i meant tool. context specification is much more than a tool. it's a holistic communication, analysis. design method
@therealhoff the only thing more mind boggling is corporate IT people who know better but who do nothing to improve the situation
@Jason_Diamond when you say 'C/S', do you mean 'framework' or 'methodology'?
@Jason_Diamond but context specification isn't a syntax, it's a methodology that has a grammar of the same name
@Jason_Diamond simple: gwt is an awkward, unnatural grammar that is too prose-ish to represent atomic facts
longing for a time when more people understand how to use context specification to replace long form requirements (including stories)
@keithb_b i was just thinking the same thing. this keeps happening again and again. i personally feel the same about fit and cucumber.
the document i hold in my hand is what happens when business people think that writing uses cases is a fulltime job for a month. primitive.
whoever told business people that writing the most and the most detailed use cases helps software development should be out of the gene pool
oh boy. use cases. nothing more enjoyable than a day reading use cases.

@gshutler try to walk away with the good bits while leaving all the celebrity-based authoritative ideas on the cutting room floor :)
@gshutler no doubt it's shallow. the issue is how to shape our actions and decisions knowing this to cause the least harm.
@gshutler no. not just me. anyone in your community that is visible. seb for example. this is how social authority and social capital works
@gshutler the perceived value of the active nodes in your social network gives you as much influence as any code you write
@gshutler a tremendous amount of choice is made in these communities based on opportunities to get close to celebrities
@gshutler never let it be said that rationality or merit ever got in the way of a bad decision in the alt/net communities :)
@gshutler google juice isn't what influences the .net community, and especially not the alt.net community
@gshutler dogfooding the wrong thing without a vision for the right thing just gets the wrong thing's bugs worked out
@gshutler it's not the dogfooding that matters, it's the years of experience in critical thinking and diversity applied to the dogfooding.
@gshutler dogfooding doesn't get us anything either if we just do the dogfooding according to our presumptions (see: Microsoft and TFS)
@gshutler it's great to have an open mind, but be conscious of the influence you have once something is released to the wild
@gshutler far too much time was spent in asp mvc design review on listening to people who had never built asp apps who are celebrities
@gshutler if the .net community at large were able to discern goodness based solely on merit, the asp mvc framework would have been better
@gshutler in the .net community, people pay attention to technology not because it's good, but because it's mentioned by celebrities
@gshutler discerning the least desirable path means synthesizing many, many more factors to arrive at a more holistic context
@gshutler you won't find a hack implementation that is undesirable, but you can inevitably differentiate least desirable.
@gshutler no doubt they're both flawed. the dialog about the least-flawed is inevitably a dialog about whole and systemic analysis.
@gshutler ultimately, i'm gonna come gunning for you if this hack-in-the-uri becomes convention in the late-to-the-game .net rest users :)
@gshutler it's going well. it's not meant to be an overnight change but a long-term campaign of subtle (and not so subtle) influence
@gshutler in the end, i still hear you saying things that kinda sound like 'because it's easier for me to do it this way'
@gshutler as an 'advocate of both Test-Driven Development and Domain Driven Design', you're guilty by association :)
@gshutler the issue here isn't just testing and testability. the issue is finding the right abstraction and applying rules for workarounds.
@gshutler it was microsoft's naivety toward testing that spurred the greater rift between the 'us' and the 'them'. it's all framework design
@gshutler once you've got rails running in your shop, there isn't much justification to run it on a slower virtual machine
@gshutler iron ruby won't make rails adoptable for .net shops. they'll still go asp.net mvc - otherwise they'd be using rails now.
@gshutler doesn't this all remind you just a little bit with alt.net's arguments with microsoft product teams about testing?
@gshutler (not 'impact11', but 'impact!!')
@gshutler test models will have have to be aware that there is more information in the uri than the resource address. that's impact11
@gshutler honesty, it's not a framework developer's position to dictate the impact of the framework on testing: see microsoft and 'sealed'
@gshutler yep, and continue to weep to watch the alt.net'ers repeat the mistakes that other cultures made years ago :)
@gshutler for the tester, it's not a matter that the impact on test models is minimal - the problem is that it's there at all
@gshutler if the asp.net mvc framework is the obstruction, never a better time to use the public github fork, and change it
@gshutler i don't readily accept that the uri is the right mechanism for representing low-level protocol mechanics. bury the hack.
@gshutler 'test models' (or 'test abstractions'): applying model-driven (or domain-driven) design to test design
@gshutler instincts tell me that having to account for the fake verb in test models will show that the verb is in the wrong place
@gshutler but that envelope issue is your problem as the framework developer :)
@gshutler you can add the hack to query string params, but that brings me back to the proximity factor
@bellware a query string param is a param for the resource address itself; refining the meaning of the essential purpose address itself
@gshutler i would always be accounting for it in testing, and inevitably tripping over it. rails used to do it this way too.
@gshutler you can append to a uri, and that's a mutation. you can add an atomic form var without mutating any others.
@gshutler to create an anti-corruption, try to do something additive first.
@gshutler putting the verb in the uri has greater semantic impact. it's not additive, it's destructive (a mutation)
@gshutler right. my bad, meant the form verb. the verb isn't in the uri.
@gshutler the form action isn't as close to the resource address itself as it is to the form data and headers (imo)
@gshutler it's a matter of where to hang the hack. it needs to corrupt the thing that it is most proximal to. in this case, the form action
@gshutler the resource address is the outermost surface - the essence - of the request; not just because it's exposed through user agent ui
@gshutler if (and only if) the hack can't be completely encapsulated, then (and only then) should it start bubbling toward the surface
@gshutler it's important to never loose track of what is happening here is a hack, and there are some good guidelines for anti-corruption
the big lebowsky has ruined my ability to watch tron. it's just too hard to retrofit @tedneward into the glowing-pants/light-cycle character
@gshutler what do you mean by 'corrupt'?
@gshutler not the visibility, but it's purpose and meaning as a resource address. the visibility comes into play when encapsulating a hack.
@gshutler i didn't come to that conclusion :) regardless of what the uri gets put into, putting stuf into the uri itself is not the same
@gshutler the resource address is the least encapsulated way to do this representation
@gshutler eitherway, it needs to be a workaround, but the workaround should be proximal to its source and more strongly encapsulated
@gshutler yes, and agree with that as well, but then i fall back to the issue of the abstraction and the proximity to the truth
@gshutler in a scenario where restful addressing is in-play, i see the uri as the resource address and only the resource address
@gshutler i think the difference here is how we conceive of a uri. i see the pseudo verb in the uri as a cognitive holdover from webforms.
@gshutler putting the pseudo verb in the form puts it right where the real verbs are. that's closer the the truth that the resource address.
@gshutler i don't want anything coupled to the resources address than the address of the resource. it's just a bad coupling.
@gshutler i can't tell you the specifics right off the bat. i can smell it though. my functional testing spider senses are screaming.
@gshutler you're going to make my life in functional testing a living hell if you put it on the uri
@gshutler and hey! it's the microsoft dev community! you could do it with a browser plugin and call it &quot;IE only' :)
@gshutler it's like one degree of separation from exposing it through the user's interface
@gshutler nonetheless, i'm pretty uncomfortable with using the uri as a compensator for infrastructural stuff
@gshutler those darned user agents continue to fail to recognize ALL the pesky verbs
@gshutler i appreciate the thinking that you're investing in this. asp mvc's sphere of influence demands it. good that you're stepping up.
@marknoble ha! nice catch. embarrassing. thanks!
@bellware i agree with you about that. it's a matter of responsibility. marketers' responsibility is to not occlude the consumer's awareness
@gshutler (i'm not a big fan of verbs being a part of a resources' address, in case you missed it :)
@gshutler and then the more proximal abstraction to from action is form data
@gshutler well, if verbs are represented by headers, then representing them there is more truthful
@gshutler i'd go back to: is a header a more pre-eminent form of representation for content specification?
@gshutler i'm not saying i have the answer here, but i'm always leary of hints of facilitation occluding representation

@jcrosby nice
@jmeowmeow I mean they'd provide a veritable buffet for vampires.  Replication would be a problem, as well as when there's no more homeless
@pbiegaj FYI, Mtn Vw had crystal clear blue skies when I got home.  Warm out of the wind &amp; in the sun.  Alas there was a strong, cool breeze
@tirsen it was so worth it though
@tirsen that's my understanding.  I ended up doing an unplanned iMac upgrade/replacement.
@pbiegaj and vampires can be classy... as opposed to zombies.
@pbiegaj thoughts of vampires: just got season 3 of Forever Knight, and Season 1 of True Blood. And planning a vampire deck for magic
@batasrki possible. Unless they could be neutered.

Yup. Perfect solution to the homeless/derilict/bum problem.

@tobytripp We trust the profit motive.  We buy health care from companies who provide best services for least money.
@keithb_b I think you'll find quite a few &quot;burned&quot; capitalists if you look.  Few escaped unless they were shielded by govt.
@jtimberman I disagree.  Corruption is present in all human activities.  Banks and Ins co's are not special.
@southda No.  Profit as the primary focus is honorable, because it is based upon win-win, not win-lose.
@eghm anything can be perverted, but the concept of profit is honorable.
@tobytripp I want my health providers motivated to care for me.
@tomasekeli any disregard of ethics is evil. Profit has nothing to do with it.
@cerebrum666 who decides how much is too much?
For some strange reason people think that &quot;profit&quot; is &quot;evil&quot;.  On the contrary, profit is honorable.  Without it, we'd still be in caves.
@casademora What do you mean by &quot;non-profit&quot;?  Who, in the provider chain, should not be making money?  Doctors?  Nurses?  Hospitals?

@therealhoff that's simple: things in austin are always a struggle. it's a crucible.
@therealhoff courage and energy are easy to come by when empathy and responsibility are already in play
@therealhoff knowing the difference is irrelevant unless it's coupled with knowing how to make a difference
@therealhoff corporate behavior is changing all the time. the issue is knowing which changes are better, and to work toward them
@hotgazpacho since there isn't a lot written about it, the absolute best thing to do is to not presume what context specification is
@therealhoff the only culture that isn't amenable to change is one that is populated by dead people
@therealhoff there are some of us who, when we work in corporate IT, change corporate IT
@Jason_Diamond yes, i meant tool. context specification is much more than a tool. it's a holistic communication, analysis. design method
@therealhoff the only thing more mind boggling is corporate IT people who know better but who do nothing to improve the situation
@Jason_Diamond when you say 'C/S', do you mean 'framework' or 'methodology'?
@Jason_Diamond but context specification isn't a syntax, it's a methodology that has a grammar of the same name
@Jason_Diamond simple: gwt is an awkward, unnatural grammar that is too prose-ish to represent atomic facts
longing for a time when more people understand how to use context specification to replace long form requirements (including stories)
@keithb_b i was just thinking the same thing. this keeps happening again and again. i personally feel the same about fit and cucumber.
the document i hold in my hand is what happens when business people think that writing uses cases is a fulltime job for a month. primitive.
whoever told business people that writing the most and the most detailed use cases helps software development should be out of the gene pool
oh boy. use cases. nothing more enjoyable than a day reading use cases.

@gshutler try to walk away with the good bits while leaving all the celebrity-based authoritative ideas on the cutting room floor :)
@gshutler no doubt it's shallow. the issue is how to shape our actions and decisions knowing this to cause the least harm.
@gshutler no. not just me. anyone in your community that is visible. seb for example. this is how social authority and social capital works
@gshutler the perceived value of the active nodes in your social network gives you as much influence as any code you write
@gshutler a tremendous amount of choice is made in these communities based on opportunities to get close to celebrities
@gshutler never let it be said that rationality or merit ever got in the way of a bad decision in the alt/net communities :)
@gshutler google juice isn't what influences the .net community, and especially not the alt.net community
@gshutler dogfooding the wrong thing without a vision for the right thing just gets the wrong thing's bugs worked out
@gshutler it's not the dogfooding that matters, it's the years of experience in critical thinking and diversity applied to the dogfooding.
@gshutler dogfooding doesn't get us anything either if we just do the dogfooding according to our presumptions (see: Microsoft and TFS)
@gshutler it's great to have an open mind, but be conscious of the influence you have once something is released to the wild
@gshutler far too much time was spent in asp mvc design review on listening to people who had never built asp apps who are celebrities
@gshutler if the .net community at large were able to discern goodness based solely on merit, the asp mvc framework would have been better
@gshutler in the .net community, people pay attention to technology not because it's good, but because it's mentioned by celebrities
@gshutler discerning the least desirable path means synthesizing many, many more factors to arrive at a more holistic context
@gshutler you won't find a hack implementation that is undesirable, but you can inevitably differentiate least desirable.
@gshutler no doubt they're both flawed. the dialog about the least-flawed is inevitably a dialog about whole and systemic analysis.
@gshutler ultimately, i'm gonna come gunning for you if this hack-in-the-uri becomes convention in the late-to-the-game .net rest users :)
@gshutler it's going well. it's not meant to be an overnight change but a long-term campaign of subtle (and not so subtle) influence
@gshutler in the end, i still hear you saying things that kinda sound like 'because it's easier for me to do it this way'
@gshutler as an 'advocate of both Test-Driven Development and Domain Driven Design', you're guilty by association :)
@gshutler the issue here isn't just testing and testability. the issue is finding the right abstraction and applying rules for workarounds.
@gshutler it was microsoft's naivety toward testing that spurred the greater rift between the 'us' and the 'them'. it's all framework design
@gshutler once you've got rails running in your shop, there isn't much justification to run it on a slower virtual machine
@gshutler iron ruby won't make rails adoptable for .net shops. they'll still go asp.net mvc - otherwise they'd be using rails now.
@gshutler doesn't this all remind you just a little bit with alt.net's arguments with microsoft product teams about testing?
@gshutler (not 'impact11', but 'impact!!')
@gshutler test models will have have to be aware that there is more information in the uri than the resource address. that's impact11
@gshutler honesty, it's not a framework developer's position to dictate the impact of the framework on testing: see microsoft and 'sealed'
@gshutler yep, and continue to weep to watch the alt.net'ers repeat the mistakes that other cultures made years ago :)
@gshutler for the tester, it's not a matter that the impact on test models is minimal - the problem is that it's there at all
@gshutler if the asp.net mvc framework is the obstruction, never a better time to use the public github fork, and change it
@gshutler i don't readily accept that the uri is the right mechanism for representing low-level protocol mechanics. bury the hack.
@gshutler 'test models' (or 'test abstractions'): applying model-driven (or domain-driven) design to test design
@gshutler instincts tell me that having to account for the fake verb in test models will show that the verb is in the wrong place
@gshutler but that envelope issue is your problem as the framework developer :)
@gshutler you can add the hack to query string params, but that brings me back to the proximity factor
@bellware a query string param is a param for the resource address itself; refining the meaning of the essential purpose address itself
@gshutler i would always be accounting for it in testing, and inevitably tripping over it. rails used to do it this way too.
@gshutler you can append to a uri, and that's a mutation. you can add an atomic form var without mutating any others.
@gshutler to create an anti-corruption, try to do something additive first.
@gshutler putting the verb in the uri has greater semantic impact. it's not additive, it's destructive (a mutation)
@gshutler right. my bad, meant the form verb. the verb isn't in the uri.
@gshutler the form action isn't as close to the resource address itself as it is to the form data and headers (imo)
@gshutler it's a matter of where to hang the hack. it needs to corrupt the thing that it is most proximal to. in this case, the form action
@gshutler the resource address is the outermost surface - the essence - of the request; not just because it's exposed through user agent ui
@gshutler if (and only if) the hack can't be completely encapsulated, then (and only then) should it start bubbling toward the surface
@gshutler it's important to never loose track of what is happening here is a hack, and there are some good guidelines for anti-corruption
the big lebowsky has ruined my ability to watch tron. it's just too hard to retrofit @tedneward into the glowing-pants/light-cycle character
@gshutler what do you mean by 'corrupt'?
@gshutler not the visibility, but it's purpose and meaning as a resource address. the visibility comes into play when encapsulating a hack.
@gshutler i didn't come to that conclusion :) regardless of what the uri gets put into, putting stuf into the uri itself is not the same
@gshutler the resource address is the least encapsulated way to do this representation
@gshutler eitherway, it needs to be a workaround, but the workaround should be proximal to its source and more strongly encapsulated
@gshutler yes, and agree with that as well, but then i fall back to the issue of the abstraction and the proximity to the truth
@gshutler in a scenario where restful addressing is in-play, i see the uri as the resource address and only the resource address
@gshutler i think the difference here is how we conceive of a uri. i see the pseudo verb in the uri as a cognitive holdover from webforms.
@gshutler putting the pseudo verb in the form puts it right where the real verbs are. that's closer the the truth that the resource address.
@gshutler i don't want anything coupled to the resources address than the address of the resource. it's just a bad coupling.
@gshutler i can't tell you the specifics right off the bat. i can smell it though. my functional testing spider senses are screaming.
@gshutler you're going to make my life in functional testing a living hell if you put it on the uri
@gshutler and hey! it's the microsoft dev community! you could do it with a browser plugin and call it &quot;IE only' :)
@gshutler it's like one degree of separation from exposing it through the user's interface
@gshutler nonetheless, i'm pretty uncomfortable with using the uri as a compensator for infrastructural stuff
@gshutler those darned user agents continue to fail to recognize ALL the pesky verbs
@gshutler i appreciate the thinking that you're investing in this. asp mvc's sphere of influence demands it. good that you're stepping up.
@marknoble ha! nice catch. embarrassing. thanks!
@bellware i agree with you about that. it's a matter of responsibility. marketers' responsibility is to not occlude the consumer's awareness
@gshutler (i'm not a big fan of verbs being a part of a resources' address, in case you missed it :)
@gshutler and then the more proximal abstraction to from action is form data
@gshutler well, if verbs are represented by headers, then representing them there is more truthful
@gshutler i'd go back to: is a header a more pre-eminent form of representation for content specification?
@gshutler i'm not saying i have the answer here, but i'm always leary of hints of facilitation occluding representation

electric cars are great, because u only have to improve 1 plant's efficiency (say coal --&gt; nuclear), instead of 10 000 gas engines.
@colin_jack i know, it just worked for us
An &quot;efficient&quot; electric car (like da volt) would be much more appealing to me if I didn't know the power was coming from a coal plant.
@RhysC pragmatically, I think its a concern because of where we find ourselves...I think in a better world, it wouldn't be.
@colin_jack no, xunit..the base class constructor runs before each test..so we do cleanup there
@colin_jack I actually made changes last night that put the cleanup in the constructor (TestFxtureSetUp) because it was cleaner/simple
@colin_jack can't disagree. I like Xunit, but my tests evolved into not using that pattern, which probably means it never felt natural

@laribee I was going to attend and heckle you by saying things like &quot;DDD sucks!&quot; or &quot;How do I use DataTables with this?&quot;
@laribee Oh, I thought you were doing the whole rockstar thing... showing up late, pitching a fit about blue M&amp;M's, etc :)
@haacked Is it someone asking how they can see who all was BCC'd on this email? :)
@therealhoff branch for spikes. &quot;Release per feature&quot; generally. Customer deployment is another issue.
@kirstinj People shy away from the disabled because it reminds us that we're not invincible and fully in control of our lives
@shanselman most ppl I know that you might call racist, don't have a problem with the color of the skin, but with perceived cultural probs
@shanselman I'd argue though that most of what people call to as 'racism' is actually more 'culturalism'
@shanselman has created in us an innate, subtle fear of difference races and culture.
@shanselman Hundreds of thousands of years of proto-humans running from other, different proto-human races coming to wipe them out...
@derickbailey On the bright side, the MembershipProvider provides an excellent example of why ISP is important.
RT @ayende Fail+10: http://bit.ly/phiG4
@ayende lol, we should teach the school kids that: The Library: It's like a video rental store, but for books!
The Cancel Button: The bane of every Microsoft application. Able to wreak havok and mayhem and crash MS apps with a single click
What if Bush had... http://bit.ly/OXZYx
 (RT @patrickmadrid)
Hire 2 ppl to replace the guy that did, neither of which understand those concepts!
What do you do when your dev team isn't familiar with things like testing and ioc c'trs?
@CurtJester &quot;Common Ground&quot; means &quot;We'll try to kill fewer of them, and we'll kill them with slightly less deathiness&quot;
@djkozora Look at AddControllerActions... UsingTypesInTheSameAssemblyAs
@tjboudreaux No. I agree. There's a hint tinge of racism in there.
@AdoroTeDevote I think I lost about 40 just by accidentally making my avatar a crucifix.
Screwtape wrings his hands and chuckles silently to himself.
@rlewallen Satan would get everyone to hate Hitler instead. The first tactic of evil is to make sure no one thinks it exists
&quot;If success is about the journey and not the destination, then why do you bother running?&quot;
Lol:  &quot;Without education we are in a horrible and deadly danger of taking educated people seriously&quot; - G.K. Chesterton
@robconery The Internets: Where it's absolutely REQUIRED that you knock it before you try it. In fact, don't try it at all.
@sbohlen A twitter spam honey pot, so to speak
People say that vacuuming is woman's work, but I say a man can vacuum just as well as a woman can! (well, ok, maybe not, but he'd try hard!)
@peterbromberg I'm sure as that lady was beaten by the police and Obama did nothing, she was thinking how wonderful it was our av's were gn
@peterbromberg Yep. I love Iran and all, but I'm not sure how turning my avatar green will help anyone.
In other news, creating 'causes' on twibbon kinda sucks
Ok, back to normal
Crap, and there's no way to change your twibbon image once your 'Cause' has been created. *harumpf*
Hrm, that's not what I ended to have happen. Twibbon, you deceived me!
Support The Catholic Church, add a #twibbon to your avatar now! - http://bit.ly/105EH
@ArgentCent he focused a lot on Gen. 3:15 as well as Proverbs 8. Why? What's their angle here? What should I be ready for?
@sbohlen Latch: http://is.gd/1Dvh5
Coca Cola, that is. I have no experience with other forms of coke
I can definitively say now that inhaling lemonade is worse than inhaling coke.
@sbohlen lol, yeah, I took it right to the edge and had to cram the cents in at the end
@benhyrman No, it was just a transfer to a new account. Took two tries, but I steeled my way through it, lol
@anglicangeek ever through about inventing a more Christian RPG (is there one already?)  Been on my mind recently playing Oblivion
@agilejoe I experience FireFox being unresponsive all the time, Mac notwithstanding
@anglicangeek Buy the physical book then download the bootleg PDF?
Ever write a REALLY big check (even just for xfering between accounts) and you get shaky and can't write it legibly?
@ArgentCent So we agreed to reconvene next week to pick it up again.
@ArgentCent I was caught unprepared, though :( I think the Holy Spirit did pretty well through me, but I should be more prepared
@ArgentCent I tried to get them off the end times, then onto the trinity (mistake), then, divinity of Christ, finally authority of Church
@McSobi Oh right. The &quot;cost to society&quot; will be too great. c.f. Aktion T4
@unclebobmartin Care for them under the then 50 year old massive gov't healthcare bureaucracy
@unclebobmartin It should comfort the Obama voters to note that the children whose future is screwed will care for them when they're 80yo
@unclebobmartin The same people who seem to hate profit are the ones that always expect raises every year
That's my contribution to society. You can thank me by buying me a beer next time you're at a conference with me :)
Just had a Jehovah's Witness pair come to the door. I was able to tie them up with theological arguments for nearly 30m
@gsherman FYI, Jill rocks. I told her shes going to have to tone down the energy though, lest she drag the rest of us up to her level
@gsherman It is work stuff. Looks like we're deploying next week.
I *REALLY* have to stop checking email on weekends. I see things that really stress me out and ruin my whole weekend
Pope broke his wrist. Went to breakfast, said Mass, THEN went to hospital, but not before hearing Chuck Norris' confession
After reading @shanselman's post, I have this vision in my mind of him throwing bullets at kids trespassing on his lawn. Dunno why.
@shanselman I'm not digging your new Twitter avatar :(  It doesn't represent you well. I like your city pic on your twitter page background
@shanselman Everything will get much better when she's a gov't employee. Don't worry!
FYI: Scott Bellware (@bellware) is looking for new opportunities. Snatch him up while you can!
OH: &quot;You know that this means XML, right?&quot;  &quot;I'm sorry. You're going to have to leave now. There's the door&quot;
