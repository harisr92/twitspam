			<h3>Website Visitors</h3> 
			<p>Like most website operators, TwitSpam.us collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. TwitSpam.us's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how TwitSpam.us's visitors use its website. From time to time, TwitSpam.us may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>

			<p>TwitSpam.us also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. TwitSpam.us does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.</p>

			<h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
			<p>Certain visitors to TwitSpam.us's websites choose to interact with TwitSpam.us in ways that require TwitSpam.us to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that TwitSpam.us gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who use our forums to provide a username and email address. In each case, TwitSpam.us collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with TwitSpam.us. TwitSpam.us does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>

			<h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
			<p>TwitSpam.us may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. However, TwitSpam.us does not disclose personally-identifying information.</p>

			<h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
			<p>TwitSpam.us discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to no one.  If we even have personally identifying information, then it's an accident and we probably don't know that we have it.</p>

			<h3>Cookies</h3>
			<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. TwitSpam.us uses cookies to help TwitSpam.us identify and track visitors, their usage of TwitSpam.us website, and their website access preferences. TwitSpam.us visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using TwitSpam.us's websites, with the drawback that certain features of TwitSpam.us's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

			<h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
			<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, TwitSpam.us may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in TwitSpam.us's sole discretion. TwitSpam.us encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
